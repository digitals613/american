        <h2>What Does Door To Door Transport Mean?</h2>
        <p>
            The term <b>"door to door" vehicle transport</b> refers to the autotransporter getting as near to your
            specified pickup and delivery locations as possible. Customers frequently mistakenly believe that
            door-to-door delivery means that the truck will pull up in front of your house to deliver your new
            automobile. This is quite uncommon. Here are a few of the reasons why:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Car carriers can be as long as 75-80 feet. Trucks of this size find it difficult to navigate in compact
                residential areas.</li>
            <li>Trucks of this size find it difficult to navigate in compact residential areas. </li>
            <li>Most car carriers have open trailers. This implies that there is no protection from low-hanging tree
                branches. Covered car travel is possible, although it can be expensive to twice as much as transport on
                an open trailer.</li>
        </ul>

                                        Driving your car may appear to be a cheaper option, but it may end up being more
                                        expensive overall. There are various economic elements involved in the process,
                                        such as the cost of fuel and refreshment stops, as well as the expense of
                                        additional wear and tear on your vehicle. A professional driver would typically
                                        charge you more to drive your automobile than the cost of door-to-door auto
                                        transportation.

                                        You can ship your car to another country which means that
                                        if you are the legal owner of a car, you are allowed to
                                        ship it overseas. While, in the case of a leased car, even
                                        though you’re the registered owner of the car, the legal
                                        owner is the leasing company. So, you are prevented from
                                        shipping a leased car across the country.

                                        Yes, dealers are willing to ship your car to wherever you
                                        live. A car being shipped to your doorstep by the
                                        dealership is convenient and comfortable. Whatever your
                                        location is, dealers transport your car to your location.
                                        But, keep in mind that dealerships do not offer this
                                        facility free. They do charge a specific amount for
                                        shipment.
