        <h2>We Don’t Oversell (Or Undersell)</h2>
        <p>
            How will you know which <a href="/car-shipping-service" target="_blank"><b>car shipping</b></a> companies to avoid? Begin looking for an automobile transporter at
            least three weeks before your preferred ship date.
        </p>
        <p>
            Considering all of the procedures involved: research, booking, and finally shipping, the process can take a
            month or more. When you speak with companies, they should never try to pressure you to schedule a
            reservation right away. Most customers who need to transport a vehicle will acquire quotations from several
            companies, so be careful of shippers who rush you to make a decision right away. A hard sell is always a
            negative sign.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's a terrible sign if they give you a high quote. It's also a warning sign if they give you a quote that's
            too low.
        </p>
        <p>
            QTS, as a reliable car transport company, will provide you with a competitive quote that considers your
            shipping requirements, your vehicle, and the overall market. We will be open and honest about pricing. Also,
            give or take cash payment options or military discounts.
