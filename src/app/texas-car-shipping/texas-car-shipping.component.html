                        "Everything is bigger in Texas," as the saying goes. From its rich
                        history and natural beauty to its culture of rodeos, BBQ, and
                        Tex-Mex, the Lone Star State provides travelers and locals with a
                        unique flavor of life that cannot be found anywhere.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Suppose you're planning a move, a family vacation, or want to check
                        out the state's football scene (Texas is home to two National
                        Football League clubs and a host of prominent university teams). In
                        that case, you're going to cover much groundâ€”the state is 268,597
                        square miles! You'll want to be able to rely on your vehicle to get
                        you where you need to go.
                    </p>
                    <div [ngClass]="{ limitTextHeight5: isReadMore }">
                        <p></p>
                        <p>
                            You also need your car to ship if you move from Texas to another
                            state due to weather conditions like tornadoes, flooding,
                            hurricanes, wildfires, and thunderstorms. Because the state is so
                            large, these conditions may differ depending on where you live. As
                            a result, if you prefer not to be exposed to a wide range of
                            extreme weather, it may be a dangerous place to call home.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So whether you are moving to Texas or moving from Texas, you need
                            the best car shipping company on which you can rely to ship your
                            car to and from Texas.

                    American Auto Transports provides affordable car transport
                    services in Texas. The cost of shipping an automobile in Texas is
                    governed by criteria such as the number of miles between the
                    pick-up and drop-off locations, mode of transportation, season,
                    size, and number of vehicles.

                <p>
                    In Texas, we provide free and accurate car shipping prices. We
                    offer expedited services at an additional cost to clients who need

                        vehicle is loaded into a trailer for shipment, it is examined,
                        and a BOL form is completed. This is to demonstrate its

                    <p>
                        When looking for car shipping to/from Texas, you should consider
                        how long it will take. Distances of fewer than 200 miles take
                        between 1 and 2 days on average. Auto shipping to/from Texas might
                        take up to 9 days for 2,000 miles or more lengths. However, rest
                        assured that our shipping advisers will do all possible to ensure
                        that you receive a timely and effective Texas auto shipping
                        service with no delays.

                    <p>
                        These averages are only guidelines because numerous things can
                        influence the actual timeline. Weather, distance, road
                        construction, detours, other traffic, seasonality, and driver's
                        hours can all impact car transportation to and from Texas. If you
                        need to quickly ship your car to or from Texas, you may speed up
                        the procedure by selecting speedy car shipment or guaranteed
                        pick-up.

                            obvious considerations. However, the cost of auto transportation
                            to/from Texas is influenced by many other equally important

        <p class="text-left">
            Without a doubt, Texas is one of the richest states in the United
            States of America. Four hundred thousand people have moved to this
            state in just five years. With this expansion rate, the Lone Star
            state will soon be a vast metropolis bursting at the seams with a
            rabid crowd. If you, like many others, desire to migrate to this
            megacity, you should do so after arranging for car transport in
            Texas. To take advantage of the state's prosperity, you'll need an
            automobile.

                                Unfortunately, Texas has maintained the "everything is larger
                                in Texas" mantra when it comes to natural calamities â€” the
                                Galveston hurricane of 1900 was the worst hurricane ever.
                                Hurricane Harvey just wreaked havoc on Houston, and every
                                year, strong thunderstorms and tropical storms wreak havoc on
                                the state.
                            </p>

                                If you believe moving inland may help, consider that Texas has
                                the most tornadoes in the country, with an average of 139 each
                                year, mostly in North Texas and the Panhandle. This is why
                                anyone shipping a vehicle to or through Texas should work with
                                a company to plan for and avoid severe weather situations.
