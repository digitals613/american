            <p>
                Maryland is a state in the United States' Mid-Atlantic area. It is
                well-known for its numerous canals and shorelines. It is also
                well-known for being one of the smallest states in the country, yet
                having a population of more than 6 million people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maryland's weather is similar to many other east coast states, with
                many tornadoes and several thunderstorms each year. Many people move
                from Maryland to another state during bad weather conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, the Port of Maryland is the second busiest auto port in the
                United States, with a significant volume of traffic and a large port
                for importing and exporting various car manufacturers.
                Transportation and government, agriculture, and manufacturing
                contribute significantly to Maryland's economy. Maryland is also one
                of the thirteen founding colonies in the United States.
