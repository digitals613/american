                            California has some of the most stunning weather in the entire
                            country. Although temperatures and climate will vary around the
                            state, Californians will generally enjoy plenty of sunshine and
                            comfortable temperatures. In contrast, Texas is significantly more
                            subject to extreme weather, including droughts, blizzards,
                            thunderstorms, hail, tornadoes, and hurricanes, which is why many
                            people move from Texas to California.

                            from Texas to California, you'll need to choose the best car
                            shipping company to transport your vehicle from Texas to
