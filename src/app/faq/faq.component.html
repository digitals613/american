              <p>The pricing of vehicles is based on current market patterns for automobile transportation across the

                needs to go, its size, vehicle condition (running, non-running, inoperable), total transport distance
                from origin to destination, transport type (open or enclosed trailer shipment), and, finally, the time

              <p>The most popular technique of transporting a vehicle is open auto transport. Approximately 95% of the
                vehicles are moved via open transit. There is no need to be concerned about your vehicle being damaged
                because the open transit is covered by a $250K insurance policy. Open transit is typically $400 to $600
                less expensive than enclosed transportation. Most clients that use covered transportation have
                high-value vehicles that require extra security. Enclosed transport is preferred for more expensive
                super vehicles since the insurance coverage is higher than open transport.</p>

              <p>The cost of shipping a vehicle is determined by several factors, including the vehicle's make and
                model, the distance it will be transported, your drop-off and pickup locations, the shipping method you
                choose, any special handling requests, whether the vehicle runs, demand, seasonal price fluctuations,
                and the price of gasoline. On most cases, transporting an automobile in an enclosed trailer is more
                expensive than shipping a vehicle on an open carrier. If you're shipping a vehicle over state lines, you
                may spend more than if you're shipping it inside the same state. Due to customs and fees, international
                automobile shipment will always be more expensive. Typically, it costs more to ship larger vehicles like
                vans or trucks.</p>

              <p>You don't have to travel long distances just to pick up your vehicle. The most drop-off and pickup
                sites are typically accessible with larger vehicle transport firms, but you should always double-check
                that these hubs are handy for you. Door-to-door service is frequently provided, although it is usually
                more expensive. When you choose door-to-door service, your vehicle will be delivered to your house (or
                workplace) rather than being dropped off at a terminal.</p>

                Some vehicle shipping firms will also ask for a copy of your driver's license. This is just for delivery
                within the United States. If you're exporting a vehicle overseas, the country that will receive your
                vehicle will have additional restrictions. You run the danger of your automobile not being released from
                the port at its destination if you don't follow the rules.</p>

              <p>Because someone will need to hand over and later accept the keys and sign off on the paperwork, most
                vehicle transport firms will demand an adult to be present at both pickup and delivery (most often the
                inspection report and the bill of lading). That someone, though, does not have to be you. If you can't
                be there personally, you can nominate a friend, coworker, neighbor, or family to be your designated
                agent for pickup and delivery. Check with the firm you're speaking with to see if this is permitted.</p>
