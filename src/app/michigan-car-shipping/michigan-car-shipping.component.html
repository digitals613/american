                    <p class="text-white">
                        Due to its northern location and proximity to water, Michigan
                        can be severely impacted by winter storms. From stinging winds
                        blowing in from Lake Michigan to snow piling up as it falls
                        across Lake Superior from Canada and hits the Upper Peninsula,
                        Michigan residents have a lot to deal with. Whereas mainland
                        Michigan typically receives 40-50 inches of lake-effect snow per
                        year, the Upper Peninsula can receive 160 inches in some years.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white">
                        When shipping a vehicle in Michigan, you'll want to engage with
                        a Michigan auto transport service that understands how to
                        safeguard your important investment. When looking for automobile
                        transport in Michigan, send your vehicle via <a href="/enclosed-autotransport"><b> enclosed auto
                            transport</b></a>to avoid damage from rain, hail, snow, freezing
                        temperatures, and other factors. It is a wise investment to have
                        your car sent to Michigan in an enclosed carrier.

                            When truck drivers can fill their trucks with ten or more
                            cars, they can provide transportation for significantly less
                            because the fuel costs are shared among so many vehicles.
                            Consider this safe choice if you want to save money and have a
                            normal car, such as a sedan or minivan.
