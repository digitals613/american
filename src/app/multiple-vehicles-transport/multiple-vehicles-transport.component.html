                <p>
                    Multi-car transport is a service that transports many automobiles at the same time, usually for the same
                    owner. Freight trucks capable of transporting up to ten automobiles in either a covered or uncovered
                    configuration are typically used. Multi-vehicle transport consolidates automotive transportation to give
                    a variety of advantages to dealerships, collectors, and multi-car owners.

                <h3 class="heading">What Are the Advantages of Multi-Car Transport?</h3>
                <p>So, what are the advantages of exporting several cars? For starters, there's the financial aspect.
                    Shipping your autos all at once with the same company is usually always less expensive than shipping
                    them one at a time with one or more different companies. Another advantage is the ease of use. Multi-car
                    shipment not only makes the booking procedure easier, but it also gives you the assurance that all your
                    vehicles will arrive at the same time.
