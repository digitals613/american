            North Dakota is a state in the Upper Midwest part of the Great Plains
            region. Interestingly, Bismarck is the state capital, yet Fargo is the
            largest city. While this state ranks in the top 20 in terms of land
            area, it is the fourth-lowest in terms of population.
        </p>
        <p>
            The state is well-known for its scenic scenery and outstanding hunting
            and fishing conditions, attracting many tourists and visitors. Nature
            lovers and outdoor enthusiasts will visit Theodore Roosevelt National
            Park and The International Peace Garden. Meanwhile, art enthusiasts
            may decide to stroll around the galleries of the Plains Art Museum.
        </p>
            <p>
                Also, North Dakota has the highest quality of life in the nation.
                That may come as a surprise, but it makes perfect sense when you
                consider that this state has it all: stunning national parks, a
                healthy environment, and a strong sense of community. That's why
                many people also move to North Dakota.
            </p>
            <p>
                While many moved from North Dakota to another state for a job, 17
                percent moved into the state for family reasons, while 23 percent
                moved out of North Dakota for family. About 13 percent moved into
                and out of North Dakota for retirement.
