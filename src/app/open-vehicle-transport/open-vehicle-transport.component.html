                <p>
                    One of the main reasons our customers look for, when asking for car shipping quotes, is because open
                    trailer car carriers can transport up to 10 vehicles at once and they guarantee <a
                        href="/Door-to-door-auto-transport">Door-to-Door car transportation</a> most of the time. This is
                    where American Auto Transports excel and that is why we pride
                    ourselves on being the best car shipping company hands down. Another major reason is that open car
                    transport is considerably less expensive and easy auto shipping choice when compared to <a

                <h2 class="text-center heading">Open Air vs. Enclosed Car Shipping</h2>
                <p>The most frequent mode of transportation for cars when shipping car across the country is open transport
                    car shipping through car carriers. An important point to note is that open car transport exposes your
                    vehicle to the natural elements. What this means is that there is very little between the weather and
                    the surface of your vehicle, as opposed to car transport in an enclosed trailer. Another add-on option
                    is <a href="/Door-to-door-auto-transport">Door-to-Door vehicle transport</a> which is a service provided
                    in both open-air transport and <a href="/enclosed-autotransport">enclosed
                        vehicle transport</a>. Chances are that you have most probably seen the 10-vehicle open transporter
                    on the
                    freeway numerous times while driving. These are 18-wheel double-decker tractor trailers capable of
                    transporting 9 to 10 vehicles. This is most likely your best option for the most efficient and cheapest
                    vehicle transport choice.</p>
