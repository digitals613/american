                Most of our shipments are picked up and delivered door to
                door with complete confidence. While other shippers do not
                keep you informed about the position and progress of your
                motorbike, we keep you informed about its exact location
                until it is safely delivered to your house. We make sure
                that transporting your motorcycle is as easy as possible for
                you.

                For an additional flexible option, we offer the best
                motorcycle shipping service between our distribution centers
                across the country. In this case, you can bring your bike to
                the local distribution center of our company and we will
                transport your bike to your designated city or state. Once
                delivered to the final destination, the motorcycle can be
                retrieved from the distribution center. In this type of
                transportation, we cost you quite less than that for
                door-to-door delivery of your bike.

                  The total cost of shipping a dirt bike varies depending on
                  the location and mode of transportation used. Prices are
                  also determined by current market trends in bike
                  transportation. The cost of transporting a dirt bike via
                  open transportation to a short distance or across the
                  country is significantly less than that of closed
                  transportation. If you have any additional questions,

                  Shipping a motorcycle to another location is a complicated
                  process that necessitates a great deal of expertise and
                  transportation knowledge. Preparing your bike, hiring a
                  carrier, loading it, removing the battery and gas from the
                  bike, and unloading it when it arrives at its destination
                  are all part of the process. But if you hire us, you won't
                  have to worry about anything. We'll take care of
                  everything.

                  The cost of shipping a motorcycle across the country
                  varies depending on the mode of transportation used. For
                  longer distances, American Auto Transports has a fixed cost of
                  around $300 to $600 per 1000 miles. For shorter distances,
                  the price is between $200 to $300. The shipping price for
                  coast to coast is a little higher.
