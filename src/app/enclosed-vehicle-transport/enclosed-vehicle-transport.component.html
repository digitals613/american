                    <p>Enclosed car transport is a kind of auto transport that offers extra vehicle safety. If you
                        need to ship an antique or expensive vehicle, this is an excellent auto transportation
                        alternative. Enclosed carriers can often only transport a few vehicles at a time which can
                        be a bit more expensive than an <a href="/open-vehicle-transport">open-air transport service</a>. If you need extra protection for
                        your vehicle, American Auto Transports is your most reliable solution for covered auto transport.
                        We are equipped with the know-how to efficiently transport any enclosed vehicle including
                        luxury, exotic, antique, and  <a href="/car-shipping-service">classic cars</a> across 50 states including Hawaii. Our reliable
                        enclosed transport car carriers ensure that your vehicle arrives in the same condition that
                        it was when it was picked up from the origin. This gives you extra peace of mind as you
                        would know that your car will have extra car protection and extra vehicle insurance coverage
                        during the whole transport process.</p>

            <h2 class="new-head">Enclosed vs open car shipping</h2>
            <p> <a href="/open-vehicle-transport">Open car shipping</a>, or <a href="/open-vehicle-transport">open auto transport</a> is a commonly used method for vehicle transport that is either
                “out in the open” or a multicar trailer without an exterior covering. This shipping style can
                accommodate up to 10 vehicles at once, though this often depends on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Car size</li>
                <li>Car Weight</li>
                <li>Demand</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Compared to enclosed car shipping, <a href="/open-vehicle-transport">open car shipping</a> is far less expensive, as more cars can be
                transported at once.</p>
            <p>Covered car transport, or enclosed auto transport, is a method used for vehicles that need protection
                inside an enclosed trailer. Enclosed trailers are smaller and can’t accommodate as many cars as an <a href="/open-vehicle-transport">open
                    trailer</a>  – on average, only 2-3 cars can be transported at once. Enclosed auto transport carriers tend to
                cost double that of <a href="/open-vehicle-transport">open carriers</a>, so this shipping method is less popular among consumers unless they
                own luxury cars that need more security. Single car enclosed transport is also updated you about the car
