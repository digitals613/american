                        Connecticut is a part of New England, bordered by Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island.
                        Connecticut is a perfect example of tiny but mighty. A large part of Connecticut is considered a
                        part of the New York metropolitan. It is only 110 miles wide, only smaller states are Rhode
                        Island and Delaware. Connecticut is ranked as the fourth by population density in America with a
                        total population of around 3.5 million residents. It is home to the 3rd oldest university, Yale,
                        in the United States. Therefore, education is one of the main reasons for the growth and demand
                        of car moving companies in Connecticut.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Last but not least, Connecticut scenery and weather conditions draw plenty of tourists as well.
                        Connecticut is quite pleasant when it comes to weather conditions. The warm summers and pleasant
                        falls add to the beauty of the state.

                        Are you looking for the best car shipping companies near me in Connecticut? In the northwest,
                        states are more connected to each other, therefore, shipping in the northwest will not be much
                        challenging for you. But, if you are looking for shipping your car outside the northwest,
                        Connecticut may seem to appear a lifetime away.

                There is a standard time for shipping in the car shipping industry,
                but if you want to ship your car to/from Connecticut quickly, you
                can go for express auto transport. This is last-minute car transport
                as your car is picked up and shipped to your location within 2-3
                business days. It is difficult to determine the exact time frame for
                express auto transport as it depends on many variables, however it
                does speed up the whole process of shipment from pick up to
                delivery.
